# This configuration file example shows how to configure the srsRAN Project gNB to allow UE's to connect to it.
# This specific example uses USRP for the RF-frontend, and creates an FDD cell with 10 MHz bandwidth.
# To run the srsRAN Project gNB with this config, use the following command:
#   sudo ./gnb -c gnb_uhd.yaml
